the Cal Poly Mustang Band website. lots of logistics simplified

## dev info

### running locally

`npm i` in both the base and frontend directory

frontend: `cd frontend` then `npm start` - starts the React dev server

backend: `npm run dev` - runs the Netlify lambda functions

### deploying

we figured out how to run this for free (thanks Netlify)

everything should automatically deploy to Netlify once pushed/merged into the main branch
